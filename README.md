CS3520 - Computer Organisation and Architecture I Assignment 1 - Reversible Prime Squares


Theoretical Background

Both 169 and 961 are the square of a prime. 169 is the reverse of 961.
We call a number a reversible prime square if:
• It is not a palindrome, and
• It is the square of a prime, and Its reverse is also the square of a prime.
• 169 and 961 are not palindromes, so both are reversible prime squares.


Problem:

Develop a program that determines and prints the first 10 reversible prime squares.
The assignment has three main parts:
1. Develop a high-level implementation of the program in C
2. Implement a MIPS assembly equivalent of the program
3. Generate a hexadecimal coded machine code equivalent of the program
